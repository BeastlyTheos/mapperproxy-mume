I also discovered that, if you run mingw64, its console window has an "options" dialog under the System menu, in which you can enable Shift+letter keys as shortcuts. If this is done, Ctrl+Shift+V will paste text from the clipboard into the console. Of course, this is not the console used in PowerShell (or, presumably, the Subsystem for Linux, which I look forward to using once the update is

One of our standard winter meals (once a week) was polish sausage,
2 cans of green beans, 1 can of tomatoes, a can of irish potates, and an onion sliced. 
 In the warmer months it was the same thing but with fresh ingredients.

Recently we built an 8' ramp for racing matchbox cars out of some old poster frames and some window weather stripping (to keep the cars in their own lane). I'm currently teaching my daughter to sew and my wife cooks with our Son. We make parachutes for toys and drop them off our landing or make pop-pop boats and let them just put around in the neighborhood pond. Plus..i restore cars, pinball/arcade games, cast metal for parts, and maintain the house..all of that you can share with kids. All it matters is thar you are doing something with them other than being in front of the tv.

Ren Heimhardt 2 cents: sandbox video games can actually help to understand science and how to make things a lot; i learned to program thanks to garry's mod; making all sorts of contraptions encouraged me to study physics, maths, programming; all kinds of science and technology that i tried to replicate with Wiremod. Powdertoy is also anither simple and fun game where you can learn a lot about thermodynamics and electronic circuits. There definitely is potential, you just have to play the right games, not just watch streamers play fortnite

spies of mississippi and other writings by stedson kennedy

bananas contain potassium, vitamin b6, vitamin c, resistant starches, and a fiber called pectin.
potassium is filtered by the kidnies
contain a lot of resistant starches, which act as fiber since they cannot be digested.
resistant starch and pectins act as prebiotic gut bacteria, because they both pass into the large intestine where they are fermented to form butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that appears to have benefitial affects on intestinal health.
research how potassium causes constitpation
research butyrate. what are the symptums of too much or too little of it
pectin could be the active ingredient. what the hell does it do?
potassium influances gastrointestinal motility. what is that?
how does potassium get digested?

Plumli narrates 'https://mume.org:4143/wiki/index.php/Embed'


“I live in Mississauga, nobody … very few people … wear a poppy. Downtown Toronto, forget it, nobody wears a poppy … Now you go to the small cities … And the rows on rows … you people who come here, you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that. These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price … Anyhow, I’m going to run [a video segment about veterans] for you people and good Canadians that bought a poppy.”

TBH, one of the things I've been reflecting on a lot since the election is that I wish the Conservative Party of Canada really stood for something, and wish I could play a role in helping define what that is. Other than balancing the budget, it seems to me that conservatism within Canada is only capable of defining itself by what it's against, and that's becoming harder and harder to sustain because there is broad consensus around the things that conservatives are wary of. I'm absolutely in the camp of "other than abortion, I don't see much issue with the causes progressives are championing," even though I'm not sold on their approach. In the States, conservatism as a movement has begun to be associated with populism and nationalism. In Ontario, the populism piece was part of Ford's appeal, although I'm not convinced he's really a populist. That whole movement doesn't really appeal to me, either - I'm just not enough of a conspiracy theorist to believe that our system is fundamentally corrupt/broken, even though I'm all for refining things to make them more efficient. So then I'm left with the question, what is it I'm looking for, and I think it's the kind of robust intellectual conservatism that I get from my Christian studies, something which is rooted in a particular worldview and is looking to build a certain kind of society based on strong families, communities, and local institutions. I don't hear that kind of conversation taking place anywhere within our political system. If the CPC could be that, I'd be happy to be part of it, but the part of the campaign that I observed didn't offer that at all.

I think it mostly comes down to a different view of the government's role in society. Rather than being the entity that solves all of our problems, I believe government should exist to empower people to solve their own problems, which requires more than reducing household taxes. I would love to see the CPC say things like, "our goal is to ensure that every household can live sustainably on a single income if that's what they choose," "our goal is to ensure that everyone who wishes to work can actually get to work," "our goal is to combat isolation by encouraging strong social infrastructure across the country." Even on the fronts where their plan was close to what I would like - such as incentivising technological innovation to combat climate change - I wish there had been a more coherent argument for something - eg. "we believe that industry is already beginning to find solutions to climate change and want to incentivize that even further with carefully designed economic tools" - instead of dodging away from the technology conversation to rail on Trudeau's plan at every opportunity.

To give context I just listened to a podcast on brexit, which argued compellingly that the root issue is that England hasn't learned not to be an empire. But it closed with the suggestion that what may happen is that Johnson will lose the election, the Parliament will be hung again, a new referendum will be held, and brexit will end. The nice sounding ending was "it may go away but the questions about our identity that it raises will remain, and we need to have a real conversation about that." And my thought is, do you think "we need to have a conversation about our identity" is going to satisfy those who are voting for Brexit and Trump?

(including and perhaps especially Joe Biden.) He had an interview with CNN lined up that he cancelled as soon as the aid came through, which seems to indicate that he was ready to publicly commit to the investigations, but he's avoiding that now that the leverage is gone because Democrats could see that as participating in corruption. On the other hand he's avoiding saying anything that would give the Democrats leverage to impeach Trump, so he doesn't weaken that relationship
